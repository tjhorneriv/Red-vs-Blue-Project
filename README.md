# Red-vs-Blue-Project
<Assessment, Analysis, and Hardening of a Vulnerable System>

This project utilized a Red vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both the pentester and SOC analyst.

As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As the Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the Red Team attack.
The logs allowed me to extract hard data and visualizations for the report.

I used this information to harden the vulnerable machine with alarms in Kibana and implemented mitigation strategies for the machine itself.

The Red-vs-Blue.pdf is the resulting presentation I delivered on my work. Enjoy!
