# Red-vs-Blue-Project
Assessment, Analysis, and Hardening of a Vulnerable System

This project utilized a Red vs. Blue Team scenario which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyste.

As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As the Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during Red Team attack.
The logs allowed me to extract hard data and visualizations for the report included in the Red-vs-Blue.pdf.
